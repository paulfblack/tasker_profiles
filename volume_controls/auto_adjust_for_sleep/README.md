# Auto-adjust for Sleep  
This profile has three different implementations. All implemenations lower the volume and brightness settings in the evening
and turn them up in the morning. The [first implementation](https://github.com/paulfblack/tasker_profiles/tree/master/volume_controls/auto_adjust_for_sleep#by-calendar-event) uses your **google calendar**, [the second](https://github.com/paulfblack/tasker_profiles/tree/master/volume_controls/auto_adjust_for_sleep#by-time-of-day) uses **preset times** of day and days
of the week, and [the last one](https://github.com/paulfblack/tasker_profiles/tree/master/volume_controls/auto_adjust_for_sleep#by-behavioral-triggers) uses the **behavioral triggers**: phone is plugged in at night and alarm goes off.  
  
## By Calendar Event
If you're like me and put sleep in your calendar I recommend using the 
[by calendar] implementation. This allows for variability should your schedule change without having 
to adjust the profile. Also, if you go on vacation, you don't have to worry about deactivating the profile, just don't put sleep 
on your calendar for that day.
